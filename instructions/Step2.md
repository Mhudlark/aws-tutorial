## Step 2: Launching an EC2 Server

Now we're going to launch a server which can host both the front end and back end of our app.

1. Using the search bar at the top of the console, search for EC2 and click it. This will take you to the EC2 console. In general you can navigate between services using this search bar.
2. Click "instances".
3. Click "launch instances".
4. For the name, choose whatever you like - e.g. "best Monash units".
5. Leave all the other configuration as default and click "launch instance".
6. You will be warned about proceeding without a key pair. This is fine, select "proceed without key pair" and click "proceed without key pair".
7. Once again, click "launch instance".
8. Click "view all instances".
9. Wait for the instance to launch - this should only take a minute or so.
